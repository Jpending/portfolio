       If you couldn't tell by now, my name is John D Pendergast,
      I am a software engineer living in Sayreville, NJ with my partner and our amazing dog, Ninja.  I have an extensive work history in both residential, and commercial construction, as well as renovation project managemment. I believe this gives my code the advantage of having aspects of being built like a home; that is, from the foundations to the finishing touches.

    <! –– why i like development -->
      <h2 class="subtitle">Why web development?</h2>
      Well, I've always been interested in the internet since we had our first dial-up connection. Everything about the internet endlessly fascinates me;'' the free sharing of information and entertainment, to videogames with friends, or the bottomless YouTube holes that can eat up an entire day's productivity! The collaborative nature of the internet is what really excites me, I love talking with others, and working together to create something big or small. I believe that even a small group of dedicated individuals can accomplish almost anything online!
